## About Face2Face

Our story began in 1998, when a few of the current group members were invited to perform live as a music ensemble inside one of the large superstores in Watford, Hertfordshire. The group became known as “St. Andrews Consort” but later changed its name to Face2Face as the group grew and began to share personal stories and testimonies of how a loving God had intervened in their lives, and could do the same for the listener. This naturally led to the concept of a “face to face” encounter with God. 

Face2Face is now comprised of nine members who are mostly professional musicians and vocalists. We also have our own PA system and support team. The vision of Face2Face is primarily to reach audiences with the love and saving grace of God through music and testimony.

Face2Face is a gospel-centred musical ministry, and doesn’t usually perform for weddings or social functions unless we have the freedom to share our faith and testimony in music and words. Individual members are available to play as a smaller group at weddings / parties.

We hope you enjoy some of the music clips on this site, and if you think we can support your evangelical outreach, do contact us and we will be happy to chat through the entire process.
