To take you through the process of booking and organising a F2F concert, we've made life a bit easier by breaking down the process, step by step.

### STEP 1 - THE TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Will the concert be aimed at the local community, a specific organisation or charity, a mainly youth oriented gathering or a general concert by invitation?
- Your target audience also helps us to put together the right programme

### STEP 2 - THE CHOSEN VENUE:
- Please consider if  the venue is big enough to stage a concert with 9 musicians, a PA team of 4 and all the audience to make it viable?
- Are there any access issues we may need to consider?
- Are there any health and safety issues we may need to consider at the chosen venue?
- Is the venue /organising party adequately covered for public liability insurance?  

### STEP 3 - THE ORGANISING TEAM:
We find it helpful if you can have a specific contact person to follow through the whole process, and a team for catering and setting up.

### STEP 4 - THE PUBLICITY:
As part of our commitment to making your event a success, we have a standard poster design, matching A4/A5 flyers and tickets, which we can customise for your use in advertising and publicising the concert. You will need to print these from the artwork we supply. The information you will need to supply is:- venue and address, date of concert, ticket price and where to obtain tickets from, and the start time of the concert.

### STEP 5 - THE PRAYER:
We are strong believers in the power of prayer. We would like to encourage you to set up a prayer team to pray through all the stages of the planning, right up to the day of the concert.

### STEP 6 - THE FINANCES:
Face2Face is a gospel centred musical ministry. None of the team are paid a salary and our personal time and resources are all donated to the ministry free of charge. We do however charge a fee for each concert in order to pay for hiring our PA equipment, paying an administrator and for general running costs of the ministry. For further details please talk to our contact person at the end of this section, who would be happy to discuss this with you. Our fee is £500 for a concert but we are happy to accommodate differing circumstances.

### STEP 7 - PAYMENT OF THE DEPOSIT:
When everything has been discussed and agreed we send you a contract . This should be signed and returned within 3 weeks with a 50% deposit which is non-refundable ,and this will secure your concert date . We ask for this because Face2Face members may have to turn down other work in order to be available for your concert date .The balance is required by cheque on the night of the concert .
If Face2Face have to cancel the concert for any reason, a new date will be offered with joint agreement .

### STEP 8 - LOOKING AFTER THE F2F TEAM:
Typically, a concert can begin with the PA team setting up their equipment starting from around  11.00 am  in the morning, with rehearsals starting at 2.00 pm. Please ensure that the venue is available at this time, otherwise we will not have adequate rehearsal time. After rehearsals, the  F2F team (approximately 14 people) will need feeding at around 6.00 pm. We will let you know any specific dietary requirements in due course. Please also ensure that there is adequate facilities for the team to change and leave any belongings in a safe and secure place. 
The concert is usually advertised for arrival at 7.15 and will start at 7.30 pm and finish at around 9.30 pm. We would appreciate tea/coffee and biscuits to  be made available for the team at the start and during the afternoon. 

### STEP 9 - THE REHEARSAL:
The team rehearse from 2-6pm and would appreciate quiet during our rehearsal times, so if possible, setting up of tables and chairs needs to be done beforehand.

### STEP 10 - THE CONCERT SETTING:
Please ensure that the venue is suitable for a relaxed café style environment concert where the audience can sit around tables, as this works well for the type of concert we do. However, we do appreciate that this arrangement may not always work so please chat to our contact about that. The concert is two 45 minute halves, with a 30 minute interval for refreshments of your choice. 
If lighting is available, we would appreciate someone on hand to adjust the lighting for our needs. Please allow 1 hour for the P.A. team to pack up at the end of the evening.

### STEP 11 - PAYMENT ON THE NIGHT:
Please make sure the correct payment (balance 50% of the fee) is made available by your treasurer for payment on the night, payable to ‘Face2face’.
