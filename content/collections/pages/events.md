## Events

As a Christian music group, we have been invited to perform our blend of music in many different venues in the UK, and previously in Russia. Our performances have taken us into concert halls, churches, shopping centres, prisons, orphanages and synagogues, to name a few. If you are interested in hosting a concert, please contact us on the website â€“ info@face2facemusic.co.uk or phone Judith on 0208 449 7324
