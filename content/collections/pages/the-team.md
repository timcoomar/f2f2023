    name: 'Nina Cook'
    instrument: Singer
    profile_text: "Since the Covid restrictions came upon us in 2020 many things have changed for us all, but for Nina (and Stephen) a wonderful opportunity to bring music and song with the message of the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ presented itself in new ways. We were able to use the 'lock down' to take our music to the local streets in summer garden concerts, street events and Christmas carol singing for the community, reminding our friends and neighbours of the wonder of the birth of the Lord Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas. Nina continues to keep her voice in good order with the help of her 'long time' highly respected singing teacher Nicholas Powell. She also has had the fun of performing some of her favourite songs,singing a wide range of music for the soprano repertoire, from German lieder, Italian arias to favourite English composers like Vaughan Williams and Ivor Novello!"
